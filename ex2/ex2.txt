***TASK #2*** (FOR ALL GROUPS; checked by the bot)

There are some necessary skills for every programmer — process files, calculate checksums, follow the instruction, etc. This task will help to train that.

Use language of your group (PHP or Python). In principle, you can use anything else, like Java, C#, Rust or Ruby or anything you like (**you don't submit the code in this task, only the result**).

1. Calculate **SHA3-256** for every file from archive (https://www.dropbox.com/s/oy2668zp1lsuseh/task2.zip?dl=1). Note, **files are binary, you don’t need encodings **— if you read file to string with some encoding, you have to use the same encoding to decode string into bytes back for hashing (there is a technical term for such conversions — “stupid activity”).

2. Write hashes as **64 hex digits in lower case.**

3. Sort hashes in the **ascending** order of the product of hex digits increased by one (for example, for the hash `63a6ba9e5de66b11ad6c6d3d1b39a5456f65f918fde6250565e365d89a5196c6` the sorting key is `71365623100112242680609229940949951316513259520000000000`).

4. Join **sorted hashes without any separator** (not keys used for sorting, but hashes themselves).

5. Concatenate resulted string with your e-mail in **lowercase**.

6. Find the SHA3-256 of the result string.

Send obtained 64 hex digits in the lower case to the https://discord.com/channels/950701840901746708/1258451022800617492 channel using the following command
```
!task2 email 64hexdigitshere
```
Note: SHA3-256 is not the same algorithm as SHA-256.

Some additional hints: 
* check if you use SHA3-256, 
* check if you process exactly 256 required files (not everything in the some directory),
* check if you concatenate your strings without separator — beware of JavaScript's join!
* check if you write e-mail in lower case and e-mail goes to the end of the resulted string, 
* and, of course, you have to calculate separate hash for every file, not to update the same hash with every file.

> **Never work with *binary* files in text editors** — if your IDE, e.g., changes automagically even a single byte, your won't get a proper result (redownload the files if necessary).

DEADLINE: this Friday, 28.11 (it's possible to submit several solutions, only the proper one counts).
