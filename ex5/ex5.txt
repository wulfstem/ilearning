The task consists of two part.

I. Generator.

Create a Google Spreadsheet (not a script, but formulas in cells) to implement a data source for the daily extraction of resources at various Weyland-Yutani Corporation mines.

The goal is as follows: the user should be able to open the spreadsheet and adjust the parameters of data generation in it.

The most important requirement is that the data should not be simple white noise — it must look _realistic_.

The following aspects should be customizable:
 * the names of the mines;
 * the date range;
 * the distribution type (at least two: uniform and normal);
 * the distribution parameters (which should update dynamically depending on the chosen distribution);
 * one or more smoothing parameters to add correlation between values;
 * day-of-week factors (e.g., Sunday output reduced by 40%) to introduce periodic patterns;
 * an overall trend;
 * events representing spikes or drops (support at least four), each with a date, duration, magnitude, and probability(*); you may use a bell-shaped curve or similar pattern for these anomalies.

Add a chart that displays the data and updates automatically when the parameters change.

(*) Optionally (it's not as trivial as probability, but isn't hard) allow to specify the number of affected mines per event instead of probability.

###

II. Create a separate Web dashboard that accesses the data source and performs analysis on the data.

Display the following — for each mine and for the total output:
* mean daily output;
* standard deviation;
* median;
* interquartile range,
* anomalies detected by the following tests (with adjustable parameters):
  * IQR rule,
  * z-score,
  * distance (percent) from moving average,
  * Grubbs' test.
* charts of different types (chosen by the user — line, bar, or stacked) with highlighted outliers and trendlines (chosen by the user — polynomial of degree 1, 2, 3, or 4).

Provide a button that generates a detailed PDF report (everything above) containing tables and charts, and separate sections about each anomaly (spike or drop).

Try to polish UI and PDF layout to make it look professional.

###

*How to submit the solution*

Send to p.lebedev@itransition.com:
1. Full name.
1. A link to the publicly accessible generator spreadsheet (anyone with the link).
1. A link to the deployed dashboard application accessible via the Internet.
1. A video demonstration showing the parameter manipulation in the generator spreadsheet, the dashboard refresh, and the PDF report being generated (no narration).

So many people submit charts with the visible spike "today" (sometimes the anomaly is lower, but these spikes are noticible outliers)... I decided not to point it out and ask to fix. I will silently reduce the grade. It will differentiate people who pay attention at least.
