***TASK 4_DATA***

Load data from DATA1 folder into pandas and clean it – ensure proper types, for example, make dates are parsed as dates, handle any duplicated, missing or malformed values.

Add a column `paid_price` = `quantity` * `unit_price` to orders (convert everything to dollars and cents, €1 = $1.2).

Extract `date` (year, month and day) from `timestamp`.

1. Compute daily revenue (sum of `paid_price` grouped by `date`) and find top 5 days by revenue.

2. Find how many real unique users there are. Note that user can change address or change phone or even provide alias instead of a real name; you need to reconciliate data. You may assume that only one field is changed.

2. Find how how many unique sets of authors there are. For example, if `John` and `Paul` wrote a book together and wrote several books separately, it means that there are 3 different sets.

3. Find the most popular (by sold book count) author (or author set).

4. Identify the top customer by total spending (list all `user_id` values for the possible different addresses, phones, e-mails, or aliases).

5. Plot a simple line chart of daily revenue using matplotlib.

Repeat for the data from DATA2 and DATA3 folders separately.

Send to me (p.lebedev@itransition.com) a link to code repository as well as a link to any kind of dashboard accessible online via browser (even static page is OK) containing three tabs/views/anything with the following:
1. Top 5 days by revenue using the format "YYYY-MM-dd".
2. Number of unique users.
3. Number of unique sets of authors.
4. The name of most popular author(s).
5. Best buyer (with aliases) as an array of ids ([id1, id2, ...])
6. Daily revenue chart

Make sure the information is presented neatly and professionally, resembling a BI dashboard rather than plain text. The use of any ready-made templates or engines is highly recommended.

Plan to submit the solution not later than Wednesday 3.12.25.
