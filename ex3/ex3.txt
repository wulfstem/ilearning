***TASK #3*** (FOR ALL GROUPS; submit the solution to the bot)

Use the language of your specialization (Python or PHP).

Implement a web method accessible via HTTP GET that accepts two natural numbers, `x` and `y`, and returns their lowest common multiple. The result should be a plain string containing only digits — not HTML or any other format. If either `x` or `y` is not a non-negative integer, return the string `NaN`.

Deploy the method so that it is accessible on the Internet at a URL that ends with your email address, where all characters except English letters and digits are replaced with underscores. For example, if your email is `p.lebedev@itransition.com`, the URL might be: `http://something.something.com:port/something/p_lebedev_itransition_com`. 

Append query parameters `?x={}&y={}` to the end of the URL during solution submission. To submit your solution, use the following template:
```
!task3 md.smith2@mail-srv.com http://free.hoster.org/app/md_smith2_mail_srv_com?x={}&y={} 
```
It’s highly recommended to wake up your server before each solution submission.

DEADLINE: 30.11.25
